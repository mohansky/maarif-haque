# Web Performance Optimization Techniques

Website performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are some essential techniques to optimize your web applications.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals are key metrics that measure user experience:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Loading performance
- **First Input Delay (FID)** - Interactivity
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Visual stability

## Optimization Strategies

### Image Optimization

Images often account for the majority of page weight. Here's how to optimize them:

- Use modern formats like WebP and AVIF
- Implement responsive images with `srcset`
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Compress images without losing quality

### Code Splitting

Break your JavaScript into smaller chunks:

```javascript
// Dynamic imports for code splitting
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

### Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching to reduce server load:

- Browser caching with proper headers
- CDN for static assets
- Service workers for offline functionality

## Measuring Performance

Use tools like:

- Lighthouse for comprehensive audits
- WebPageTest for detailed analysis
- Chrome DevTools for debugging

Remember: Performance is a feature, not an afterthought!
