 Video/audio editing posed problems for both users and Express’ end. Quick Actions was a way for Adobe Express to showcase video editing capabilities and and for users to discover them easily and use them to quickly edit their projects. It also was an opportunity for Express to help the users get a feel of the powers of the app and thereby convert them into Express users. Quick actions helped users new to video editing workflows complete singular editing tasks through focused workflows.

I led the Video Quick Actions workflow & framework designs. I worked with 2 Product Managers, the Image Quick Action design team and two Engineerinng Teams spread across two geographies.

I worked on Video Quick Actions for 2 years where we updated the framework twice, reworked on the workflows multiple times to constantly make the experience efficient and thereby quick with each iteration. FI was responsible for creating individual quick actions which let users edit quickly to gathering feedback to defining the experience in the editor.
