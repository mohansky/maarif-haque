# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of building with Astro.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro offers several compelling advantages:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only ship JS when you need it
- **Component islands** - Interactive components in static sites
- **Framework agnostic** - Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- **Built-in optimizations** - Image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

## Key Features

### Static Site Generation

Astro excels at generating static sites that load incredibly fast. Your content is pre-rendered at build time, resulting in optimal performance.

### Component Islands

When you do need interactivity, Astro's island architecture lets you hydrate only the components that need JavaScript, keeping the rest of your page static.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm create astro@latest
cd my-astro-site
npm run dev
```
